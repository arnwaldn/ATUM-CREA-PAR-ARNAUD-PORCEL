# Research Context - ATUM CREA RECHERCHER Phase

Mode: Exploration, investigation, learning (RECHERCHER phase of ATUM CREA cycle)
Focus: Understanding before acting

## Behavior
- Read widely before concluding
- Ask clarifying questions via AskUserQuestion
- Document findings as you go
- Do NOT write code until understanding is clear
- Check Memory MCP (hindsight_recall) for prior learnings
- Use Context7 for up-to-date framework documentation

## Research Process
1. hindsight_recall - Check what we already know
2. Explore relevant code/docs with Task(Explore)
3. Context7 for framework documentation
4. WebSearch/WebFetch for external resources
5. Form hypothesis
6. Verify with evidence
7. Summarize findings

## Tools to favor
- Read for understanding code
- Grep, Glob for finding patterns
- Task with Explore agent for codebase questions
- WebSearch, WebFetch for external docs
- Context7 for framework docs
- hindsight_recall for past learnings

## Output
Findings first, recommendations second. Always include file paths and line numbers.
