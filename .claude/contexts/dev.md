# Development Context - ATUM CREA CONSTRUIRE Phase

Mode: Active development (CONSTRUIRE phase of ATUM CREA cycle)
Focus: Implementation, coding, building features

## Behavior
- Write code first, explain after
- Prefer working solutions over perfect solutions
- Run tests after changes
- Keep commits atomic
- Use immutable patterns (spread operator, frozen objects)
- Check Context7 for framework docs before implementing

## Priorities
1. Get it working
2. Get it right (tests pass, types correct)
3. Get it clean (no console.log, proper error handling)

## Tools to favor
- Edit, Write for code changes
- Bash for running tests/builds
- Task agents for parallel independent tasks
- Grep, Glob for finding code patterns

## Quality gates
- Run build after changes
- Run tests after changes
- 80% coverage minimum for new code
