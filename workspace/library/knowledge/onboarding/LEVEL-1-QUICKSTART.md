# ULTRA-CREATE Quickstart (5 minutes)

> **Level 1** | For first-time users | Read time: 5 minutes

## What is ULTRA-CREATE?

An autonomous AI development system that builds complete projects from natural language descriptions. Just describe what you want, and Claude builds it.

---

## 3 Things You Need to Know

### 1. Just Ask Naturally

No special syntax needed. Examples:

```
"Create a restaurant website with reservations"
"Debug this error: TypeError..."
"Make a 2D platformer game"
"Build a SaaS with Stripe payments"
```

### 2. Core Commands (Only 5)

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/wake` | Activate full system |
| `/create [idea]` | Build a new project |
| `/debug [error]` | Fix any error |
| `/deploy` | Push to production |
| `/help` | Get assistance |

### 3. Memory is Automatic

ULTRA-CREATE remembers:
- Errors you've fixed before
- Patterns that worked
- Your project preferences

No setup required.

---

## Your First Project (2 minutes)

Just type:

```
Create a simple todo app
```

ULTRA-CREATE will:
1. Choose the best tech stack
2. Generate all the code
3. Set up the project structure
4. Tell you how to run it

---

## Tech Stack (Default)

When you don't specify, ULTRA-CREATE uses:

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15 + React 19 |
| Styling | TailwindCSS 4 + shadcn/ui |
| Backend | Supabase or Hono |
| Auth | Clerk or Supabase Auth |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Supabase) |

You can request different tech anytime.
